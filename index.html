      <p> was very happy to meet the Dragon Boat team who will be representing China at the “Tokyo Olympics Dragon Boat Performance Event” today, and I’m also extremely honoured to be the “Dragon Boat Ambassador” and the “Olympic Dragon Boat Performance Event Ambassador”. I hope to physically support the Dragon Boat event so it can become an official competitive Olympic event.
In China, “dragon” is traditionally considered a cultural symbol and an important image, and dragon boating is also a traditional sporting event originating from China. In recent years, many more countries around the world have quickly gained interest in the sport, and it was officially made a competitive event at the 2010 Asia World Games. I hope the Olympic Games will also make it an official competitive event soon as well so it can shine at the world’s most prestigious sporting stage!</p>

      <p> It’s that time of year again and I’ve received so many messages and well wishes. I’d like to say a heartfelt “thank you” to all my friends and fans from all over the world for your warm birthday wishes! Last year, everything was put to a halt because of COVID-19 and luckily, things are starting to get back to normal again. A lot of people have been asking me about the back pain that I had earlier on. I just want to let everyone know, don’t worry! I’m feeling a lot better now. I went to visit the JC Stunt Team Training Centre today to do some preparation and training for my next movie. Honestly for me, working on my birthday is like giving my birthday the biggest respect ever. Ha ha! Especially after thinking about the days when I stopped working because of the pandemic, being able to start work again is considered very fortunate. I also hope everyone will appreciate these fortunate and encouraging times. Thanks again for all your birthday messages! Wishing everyone peace, happiness, and good health!
